# MovingCar


* TODO #1 call the `drawCar` function again in a different location with a different length
* TODO #2 modify the `drawCar` function so that it takes a 4th input named c for color. 
    Note: Once you have modified the drawCar function, you should get an error. Why? 
	How can you fix the error?
* TODO #3 create a variable to store the color `BLUE`
  * Note that the `BLUE` variable is in all caps, not in camelCase. This is because BLUE is actually a constant, meaning that its value should not really change. Variables in all caps signal to other programmers that they should not change the value of that variable.
* TODO #4 call your new `drawCar` function to draw a blue car with length of 50 at location (100, 50)    
* TODO #5 create a car that follows the mouse. 
* TODO #6 use your function to create a car that drives across the screen from left to right and loops back to the left.

When you are done you should have *at least 4* different cars in your sketch.
* One that follows the mouse.
* One that drives across the screen.
* A blue car at (100,50) with a length of 50.
* A 4th car (the original)
